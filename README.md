# **MinilibX**

42 (Paris)

### **Description**

Simplified **graphics programming** interface written in **C**.

This is the native version for **MacOSX**. It no longer uses **X11**
graphics libraries, neither **XQuartz**.

This version uses instead MacOSX's **Cocoa** window system (**AppKit**) and the modern **OpenGL** graphics primitives.

### **Credits**

This is a simple optimization based on the remarkable work made
by **Olivier Crouzet (Ol)**.
